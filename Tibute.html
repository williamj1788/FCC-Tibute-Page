				<h5 class="infoTitle">History</h5>
				<p id="historyText">One-Punch Man is an ongoing Japanese superhero webcomic created by ONE which began publication in early 2009. The series quickly 
				went viral, surpassing 7.9 million hits in June 2012.The Japanese shortened name Wanpanman is a play on the long-running children's character Anpanman, wanpan being a 
				contraction of wanpanchi ("one punch"). One-Punch Man tells the story of Saitama, an extremely overpowered superhero who has grown bored by the absence of challenge in his 
				fight against evil and seeks to find a worthy opponent. A digital manga remake of the series, illustrated by Yusuke Murata, began publication on Shueisha's Young Jump Web Comics 
				website in 2012. The chapters are periodically collected and printed into tank≈çbon volumes, with sixteen volumes released as of April 4, 2018. Viz Media has licensed the remake 
				for English serialization in its Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine. An anime television adaptation by Madhouse aired in Japan between October and December 2015. 
				It was dubbed in English during the summer of 2016, and later that year a planned second season was announced. On September 25, 2017, it was announced that they would be changing 
				both its production company and director.</p>
				<h5 class="infoTitle">Summary</h5>
				<p id="summaryText">In a world of superhuman beings, Saitama is a unique hero, he can defeat enemies with a single punch. But being just one hero in a world filled with them, 
				his life is empty and hollow: he gets no respect from anyone, he displays a laidback attitude to everything and for the most part, he finds his overall hero life pointless... 
				and worst of all, he lost his hair due to intense training. These are the adventures of an ordinary yet extraordinary hero.</p>
